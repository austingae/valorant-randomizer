----------
SEO: 
In this project, I learned for the first time about Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

- SEO v SEM: 
SEO focuses on getting traffic from organic search, aka non-paid search results. On the other hand, SEM focuses on getting traffic from both organic and paid search. In short, SEM includes SEO.

- Google Search Engine --- Crawl, Index, and Ranking
Google Search crawls, which means discovering new and updated website pages; then it indexes, which means adding information of the website pages to its index, aka database; and then it ranks the website pages for specific queries.

- How to do SEO
1) Meta Tags: In _app.js, add meta tags for robots, viewport, and charset. In every page, add a <title> and a meta tag for description.

2) Sitemap: Insert a sitemap in xml format for your website, and then ping Google to read your sitemap. A sitemap is a list of urls for Google to crawl.

sitemap format: https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html
google documentation on sitemap: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap

3) Backlinks: Garner some rel=dofollow backlinks, which are dofollow links from other websites that direct to your website. Getting dofollow backlinks tells Google that other websites find your website trustworthy; therefore, Google will increase your ranking. Backlinks from authoritative websites are valuable.

4) Maximize Google Page Experience:
- Core Web Vitals
  1) Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): This measures how long it takes for a page to load.
  2) First Input Delay (FID): This measures how long it takes for your user to actually interact with your website page. 
  3) Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):  This measures how much a website page unexpectedly shifts during its life. 
- Mobile-Friendly: This measures if the website works on a mobile device.
- HTTPS: This checks whether your site's connection is secured.
- No Intrusive Interstitials: This measures whether the content on the website page is easily accessible to the user.

5) Search Intent
4 types of search intent:
- navigational intent
- informational intent
- transactional intent
- commerical intent
If the user searches for "Subaru website", then the user has a navigational intent, aka trying to find the website intent. Brand names, name of a product, name of a service indicate navigational search intent. Site links, twitter box, and knowledge panel indicate navigational search intent. 

If the user searches for "What's a good car?", then the user has an informational intent, aka trying to find information on the topic. How, what, who, where, why, guide tutorial resource, ideas, tips, advice, learn, examples  indicate informational search intent. Featured snippets, knowledge card, videos, and people also ask also indicate informational search intent.

If the user searches for "Subaru vs Nissan", then the user has commerical intent, aka trying to learn more before making a purchase. best, top, review, attribute of a product (size, color), comparsion of two things indicate commerical search intent. adwords and featured snippets indicate commerical search intent. 

If the user searches for "buy subaru forester", then the user has a transactional intent, aka trying to buy a specific brand car. buy, coupon, order, near me, purchase, cheap, price, pricing indicate transactional search intent. adwords and shopping results indicate transactional search intent.

https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-intent/

After determining the search intent for your keywords, analyze the content type, content format, and content angle. For example, if you look up "how to make pancakes", that is an informational search intent. The search results for "how to make pancakes" show that the content type is blog posts, content format are mainly how-to guides and step-by-step tutorials, and content angle are "easy to make pancakes" and "everyday pancakes." So make your content align with the dominant content type (blog posts), content format (how-to guides and step-by-step tutorials), and content angle!

My Exercise:
Keywords: "how to swim"
"How to swim" has a information search intent. The content type is blog post. The content format is how to guides, step by step tutorial, and lists. The content angle is "beginners." So make my content align with the dominant content type, content format, and content angle. 

6) LSI keywords: LSI keywords are words that are related to your main topic or keyword. For example, my keyword is "Valorant Randomizer," then my LSI keywords are randomize, random, agents, weapons, generator, valorant, etc. Add LSI keywords into your content to tell Google that "hey, this content is relevant to the keyword."

That's all I learned so far of SEO. I have the basics down, and I am going to learn other things: improving my skills in ReactJS, beginning to learn a little bit of design, and learning back-end technologies.

Marketing:
In this project, I marketed my Valorant Randomizer to content creators. I emailed 53 content creators if they can use my randomizer, and only one said yes. That's a 1.88% success rate. The replier has over 200,000 youtube subscribers; his name is Shakes. He said that he will use it for a future content.

Serif Fonts (traditional font) vs San Serif Fonts (modern font)

- Government Websites:
Serif 
https://www.justice.gov/
https://www.state.gov/
https://www.commerce.gov/
https://www.whitehouse.gov/

San Serif
https://www.cia.gov/ - CIA in its modernity. 
https://www.fbijobs.gov/ - FBI in its modernity.
https://www.dhs.gov/ 
https://www.energy.gov/ - Energy Department in its modernity to stay updated with the newest energy technologies.

https://www.netflix.com/
https://www.nintendo.com/
https://www.marvel.com/

- Law Firms: 
Some law firms' websites use serifs while others use san serifs. some of them use a combination of both. 

- News Websites:
Serif: 
https://www.wsj.com/
https://www.washingtonpost.com/
https://www.nytimes.com/
https://www.theguardian.com/us

San Serifs:
https://techcrunch.com/ - techncrunch uses san serifs to make the website feel modern because its website is all about informing us about technologies news
https://www.theverge.com/ - same reason 
https://gizmodo.com/ - same reason
https://www.wired.com/ - same reason

- University Websites
Old Universities -- like Harvard, University of Rochestor, Yale University, and William and Mary College -- use a combination of Serif and San Serif. One thing I recognized was that headlines are usually Serif, and the texts below are usually San Serif; I think the universities made it this way to have a mix of traditional but modern feel to their websites. 

Some newer universities -- like UCLA and UCSD -- have San Serifs because they were not founded centuries ago and are pretty much modern universities. 

Universities that focus on STEM -- like CalTech and MIT -- use San Serif to give their websites a modernity look to it because technology is modernity.
