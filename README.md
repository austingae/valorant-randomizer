List of Things to Work On:
1) How to get a domain name and slap it onto the website made with next.js
2) How to do SEO (search engine optimization) to get my website ranking up there
3) Change my website favicon
4) Get a list of valorant streamers and youtubers emails, and then message them if they are interested in using this. Also, post this on reddit with the title: "I created a website that randomizes your characters, your guns, and also missions you have to complete every round!" Then post pictures of my website along with a link."
5) Then see if the website will attract people.
